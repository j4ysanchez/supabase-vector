# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Python CLI application that enables users to ingest text documents into a Supabase vector database. The application will use the nomic-embed-text embedding model running on Ollama to convert text documents into vector embeddings for storage and retrieval. The CLI will provide commands for document ingestion, database management, and potentially querying the stored vectors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ingest .txt documents into a vector database, so that I can store and retrieve document embeddings for semantic search and analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a .txt file path THEN the system SHALL read the file content and process it for embedding
2. WHEN the file content is processed THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings using the nomic-embed-text model via Ollama
3. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL store them in Supabase with associated metadata
4. IF the file cannot be read THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN ingestion is complete THEN the system SHALL confirm successful storage with document details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure database connections and embedding settings, so that I can customize the application for my specific Supabase instance and Ollama setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from environment variables or config files
2. WHEN Supabase credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL establish a connection to the database
3. WHEN Ollama connection details are provided THEN the system SHALL verify connectivity to the embedding service
4. IF configuration is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with setup instructions
5. WHEN configuration is valid THEN the system SHALL proceed with normal operation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use command-line interface commands, so that I can easily ingest documents and manage the vector database from the terminal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the CLI without arguments THEN the system SHALL display help information and available commands
2. WHEN the user runs an ingest command with a file path THEN the system SHALL process the specified document
3. WHEN the user runs an ingest command with a directory path THEN the system SHALL process all .txt files in the directory
4. WHEN the user requests help THEN the system SHALL display detailed usage instructions for each command
5. IF invalid arguments are provided THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and usage hints

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor the application's performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs during embedding generation THEN the system SHALL log the error details and continue processing other files
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and log failure details
3. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about service availability
4. WHEN processing multiple files THEN the system SHALL report progress and any individual file failures
5. WHEN verbose logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL output detailed operation information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage document metadata and chunking, so that I can optimize storage and retrieval of large documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document exceeds a configurable size limit THEN the system SHALL split it into smaller chunks
2. WHEN documents are chunked THEN the system SHALL maintain relationships between chunks and source documents
3. WHEN storing embeddings THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as filename, chunk index, and timestamp
4. WHEN duplicate documents are detected THEN the system SHALL either skip or update existing entries based on configuration
5. WHEN chunk size is configured THEN the system SHALL respect the specified limits for optimal embedding quality
